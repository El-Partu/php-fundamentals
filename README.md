# VARIABLES

Variables just in other programming languages it is container for storing data. In our everyday life we have variables around us but just that we don't call them by the name "variable".Variables can range from something simple as a cup to something as complex as a house. Every variable has a name and by that name it's called by. Just like a container that holds water for us to drink is called cup and everytime we want something to drink water we say _"get me the cup"_. So are variables.

### `Types of variables`

- Single value variables: These are variables that can take on a single value. This varibles take on a single value at a time, let's take a real life example, let's consider a cup, a cup is single value variable because at every time it contains a one specific liquid. Unless we trying to go out of the normal, by putting two unrelated liquids in one cup.
  `examples: $firstName = "Adjoa"; , $age = 20;`
- Multi-value variables: These are variables that can take on several values of any type (_NB_: in some languages like php) or of the same type. Let's consider an everyday life example, consider a **Cabinet**, it is a single whole container but inside it there are several division in it and these divisions you try as much as posible to keep one specific group of item in it to help you when you to find them . This is basically what multi-value variables are, a giant container with divisions and this division we keep a specific item in the division.
  `example of this variable are arra: $arr = ["3", "good", 4]; , objects: $obj = ["firstName"=>"Sheniel", "secondName"=>"Entsuah"]; `
